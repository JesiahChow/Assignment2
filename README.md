1. Design Process:
   For our assignment 2, we will be doing a trivia quiz both suitable for the elderly and younger generations like us. These idea was taken from a youtube video when I came across a person creating a quiz game and I found it interesting and I thought it will be good for this assignment.It will be fun and educational quiz for all ages to learn and at the same time improve their general knowledge and train their mind. There will be a total of 10 questions of 3 different topics to choose from.
   The topics are general knowledge, sports and politics.There will be a range of difficulties ranging from easy, medium to hard.
   To add some spice to the quiz, you will be given 3 hearts which represents 3 lives for the quiz.Each time you answered a question incorrectly, a live will be taken off. After 3 incorrect answers, you are out of the game and will be directed to the leaderboard section to see your results (if you did not see your results means you did not do as well as the top 5s). Now that is a challenge that users have to overcome.

2. There will be a total of 7 pages.

- Start page
- Sign in
- Login
- Homepage
- Game menu
- Gameplay
- Leaderboards

5. Features:

- There will be a login and signup page for users to login and play.

- Start button in game menu page will be disabled if user did not input their category, difficulty and ranked.

- There will be 3 interactive buttons that will be available for users: the 'Play','Leaderboard' and 'Exit' buttons.

- There will be 3 hearts for which are 3 lives given. If you answer 3 questions incorrectly, the game will end immediately.

- For easy questions, for every correctly answered question, the user will be awarded 5 points until the user completed the quiz or lost 3 lives.

- For medium questions, for every correctly answered question, the user will be awarded 10 points.

- For hard questions, for every correctly answered question, the user will be awarded 20 points

6. Technologies Used:

- HTML: The primary language use for creating websites. For our website the main language we use is mostly HTML.
- CSS : A mark-up language to aid HTML language. We used it to style our website.
- Javascript : The language I had added in to implement human interactions and enable certain functions to work.
- JQuery: A simplified version of Javascript, where we can simplify event handling.
- API: We get data from third-party database and from RestDB where we will fetch the API and use it for our quiz and for storing user account information respectively.

7. Testing:

- The login and signup form should be validated.
- User should be awarded points that matches its difficutly. For example: Easy will be 5 points per question.
- The user should be able to gain points when clicked the correct answer.
- The user should not be given points when clicking the wrong answer and will proceed to the next question.
- When user click the wrong or correct answer, an audio will sound which indicate whether you selected the correct or wrong answer.
- The user should be able to see themselves and others in the leaderboards.

8. Github link : https://jesiahchow.github.io/Assignment2/ (when i pressed this github link it does not play the audio at the start page but if you view deployment from github it plays the background audio.)

9. Bugs:

- When we fetched the API from a third party API database website, there were lots of weird characters inside the string
  of questions such as "At what& year..." which makes it unreadable for user and so we had to manually replace them one by one so that the quiz questions and answers would be readable for all.
