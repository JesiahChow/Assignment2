Design Process:
For our assignment 2, we will be doing a trivia quiz both suitable for the elderly and younger generations like us. These idea was taken from a youtube video when I came across a person creating a quiz game and I found it interesting and I thought it will be good for this assignment.<br>It will be fun and educational quiz for all ages to learn and at the same time improve their general knowledge and train their mind. There will be a total of 10 questions of 3 different topics to choose from.<br>
The topics are general knowledge, sports and politics.There will be a range of difficulties ranging from easy, medium to hard.
To add some spice to the quiz, you will be given 3 hearts for the quiz.<br>Once you answered incorrectly 3 times for the whole quiz, you are out. Now that is a challenge to overcome. In addition there will be a leaderboard where you can compare your scores to others.

There will be a total of 7 pages including sign in and login pages.

- Start page
- Sign in
- Login
- Homepage
- Game menu
- Gameplay
- Leaderboards

Features:

- There will be a login and signup page for users to login and play.

- Start button in game menu page should be disabled if user did not input their category, difficulty and ranked.

- There will be 3 interactive buttons that will be available for users: the 'Play','Leaderboard' and 'Exit' buttons.

- There will be 3 hearts which are 3 chances given. If you answer each question incorrectly 3 times, the game will end where you left of.

- For easy questions, for every correctly answered question, the user will be awarded 5 points until the user completed the quiz or lost 3 chances.

- For medium questions, for every correctly answered question, the user will be awarded 10 points.

Technologies Used:

- HTML: The primary language use for creating websites. For our website the main language we use is mostly HTML.
- CSS : A mark-up language to aid HTML language. We used it to style our website.
- Javascript : The language I had added in to implement human interactions and enable certain functions to work.
- JQuery: A simplified version of Javascript, where we can simplify event handling.
- API: We get data from third-party database where we can fetch the API and use it for our quiz.

Testing:

- The login and signup form should be validated.
- The user should be able to gain points when clicked the correct answer.
- The user should be given points of the specific difficulty when clicking the wrong answer and will proceed to the next question.
- When clicking the wrong or correct answer, an audio will sound which indicate whether you selected the correct or wrong answer.
- The user should be able to see themselves and others in the leaderboards.

Bugs:

- There are times when the third party API fetched too many correct and incorrect answers. So we had to continuously reload<br>
  the gameplay page till we got correct answers and incorrect answers.
