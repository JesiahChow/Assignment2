Design Process:
For our assignment 2, we will be doing a trivia quiz both suitable for the elderly and younger generations like us. It will be fun and educational quiz for all ages to learn and at the same time improve their general knowledge and train their mind. There will be a total of 10 questions of 3 different topics to choose from.<br>
The topics are general knowledge, sports and politics.There will be a range of difficulties ranging from easy, medium to hard.
To add spice to the quiz there will be a leaderboard where you can compare your scores to others.

There will be a total of 7 pages including sign in and login pages.

Features:

- There will be 2 interactive buttons that will be available for users such as the 'Play' and 'Leaderboard' buttons

- There will be 3 hearts which are 3 chances given. If you answer the question wrongly 3 times, no points will be awarded and the game will end.

- For easy questions, for every correctly answered question, the user will be awarded 5 points until the user completed the quiz or lost 3 chances.

- For medium questions, for every correctly answered question, the user will be awarded 10 points.

- For hard questions, for every correctly answered question, the user will be awarded 20 points

Technologies Used:

- HTML: The primary language use for creating websites. For our website the main language we use is mostly HTML.
- CSS : A mark-up language to aid HTML language. We used it to style our website.
- Javascript : The language I had added in to implement human interactions and enable certain functions to work.
- JQuery: A simplified version of Javascript, where we can simplify event handling.
- API: We get data from third-party database where we can fetch the API and use it for our quiz.

Testing:

- The login and signup form should be validated
- The user should be able to gain points when clicked the correct answer
- The user should be given points when clicking the wrong answer and will proceed to the next question
- When clicking the wrong or correct answer, an audio will sound which indicate whether you selected the correct or wrong answer.
- The user should be able to see themselves in the leaderboards and others

Bugs:

- While doing this assignment, we ran across this bug where we added audio for our background music. When we ran the start page unto live server<br> there was no sound. It is only when we move to another page and back to the start page then there is sound which we find a little weird.
