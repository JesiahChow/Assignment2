Technologies Used:

- HTML: The primary language use for creating websites. For our website the main language we use is mostly HTML.
- CSS : A mark-up language to aid HTML language. We used it to style our website.
- Javascript : The language I had added in to implement human interactions and enable certain functions to work.
- JQuery: A simplified version of Javascript, where we can simplify event handling.
- API: We get data from third-party database where we can fetch the API and use it for our quiz.

Testing:

- The user can select their desired settings for the quiz
- The user should be able to gain points, lose by lives or running out of time, and win by finishing the quiz
- The user should be able to see themselves in the leaderboards and others
